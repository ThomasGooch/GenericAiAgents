**Accepted** - September 23, 2025

## Context
Our agent system needs to support different communication patterns and protocols (in-memory for testing, HTTP for distributed scenarios, message queues for async processing). We needed a flexible approach that could adapt to different deployment architectures.

## Decision
We will implement a communication abstraction layer using `ICommunicationChannel` interface with multiple implementations: `InMemoryChannel` for testing/single-process scenarios and `BaseChannel` as foundation for distributed communication protocols.

## Rationale
1. **Protocol Agnostic**: Support for multiple communication patterns
2. **Deployment Flexibility**: Same code works in single-process or distributed scenarios
3. **Testing**: In-memory implementation enables easy testing
4. **Extensibility**: New communication protocols can be added easily
5. **Performance**: Can optimize for specific deployment scenarios

## Consequences
### Positive
- Support for multiple deployment architectures
- Easy testing with in-memory communication
- Protocol-agnostic agent development
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Future-proof for new communication patterns

### Negative
- Additional abstraction layer complexity
- Need to handle different failure modes per protocol
- Serialization concerns for distributed scenarios
- Potential over-engineering for simple scenarios

## Implementation
- `ICommunicationChannel` defines communication contract
- `CommunicationRequest/Response` models for message structure
- `InMemoryChannel` for single-process communication
- `BaseChannel` foundation for distributed protocols
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
