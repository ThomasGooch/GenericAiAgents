## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. Each ADR follows a standard format:

- **Status**: Current status (Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Author**: Decision maker
- **Context**: Situation and forces at play
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative impacts

## Contributing

When making significant architectural changes:

1. Create a new ADR using the next sequential number
2. Follow the established format and structure
3. Update this index file
4. Get architectural decisions reviewed by the team
