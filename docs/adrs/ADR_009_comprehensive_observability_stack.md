# ADR-009: Comprehensive Observability Stack

## Status
**Accepted** - September 23, 2025

## Author
Thomas Gooch

## Context
For a production-ready agent system, we needed comprehensive observability including metrics collection, health checking, and performance monitoring. We considered building custom monitoring, using external services, or implementing a hybrid approach with standard tools like Prometheus.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive observability stack with `IMetricsCollector` for custom metrics, `IHealthCheckService` for system health monitoring, and integration with Prometheus/Grafana for visualization and alerting.

## Rationale
1. **Production Readiness**: Essential for monitoring system health in production
2. **Custom Metrics**: Agent-specific metrics beyond standard system metrics
3. **Industry Standards**: Prometheus/Grafana are widely adopted monitoring tools
4. **Health Checking**: Built-in support for component health validation
5. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor agent execution times and resource usage

## Consequences
### Positive
- Comprehensive system monitoring capabilities
- Custom metrics for agent-specific operations
- Integration with industry-standard monitoring tools
- Health checking for proactive issue detection
- Performance optimization insights

### Negative
- Additional complexity in system design
- Monitoring infrastructure requirements
- Potential performance overhead from metrics collection
- Need to define meaningful metrics and alerts

## Implementation
- `MetricsCollector` tracks custom application metrics
- `HealthCheckService` monitors system and component health
- Integration with Prometheus metrics format
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Health check endpoints for load balancer integration
