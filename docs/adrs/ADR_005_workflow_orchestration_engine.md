# ADR-005: Workflow Orchestration Engine

## Status
**Accepted** - September 23, 2025

## Author
Thomas Gooch

## Context
Complex agent operations often require coordinating multiple agents and steps in specific sequences. We needed to decide between simple sequential execution, external workflow engines (like Azure Logic Apps, Apache Airflow), or building an internal orchestration capability.

## Decision
We will implement an internal workflow orchestration engine (`IWorkflowEngine`) that supports sequential, parallel, and dependency-based execution modes with built-in retry policies and error handling.

## Rationale
1. **Control**: Full control over workflow execution and optimization
2. **Integration**: Tight integration with our agent and tool systems
3. **Flexibility**: Support for multiple execution patterns (sequential, parallel, conditional)
4. **Lightweight**: No external dependencies or infrastructure requirements
5. **Extensibility**: Can be extended with custom execution strategies

## Consequences
### Positive
- Native integration with our agent architecture
- Support for complex workflow patterns
- Built-in retry and error handling capabilities
- No external infrastructure dependencies
- Customizable execution strategies

### Negative
- Additional complexity in our codebase
- Need to implement features that exist in mature workflow engines
- Potential reinvention of established patterns
- Maintenance burden for workflow logic

## Implementation
- `WorkflowDefinition` models define workflow structure
- `WorkflowEngine` coordinates execution across multiple agents
- Support for `Sequential`, `Parallel`, and `Dependency` execution modes
- `RetryPolicy` configuration for resilient execution
- Integration with health checking and monitoring systems
