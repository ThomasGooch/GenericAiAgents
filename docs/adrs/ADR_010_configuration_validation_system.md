# ADR-010: Configuration Validation System

## Status
**Accepted** - September 23, 2025

## Author
Thomas Gooch

## Context
Our agent system has complex configuration requirements across multiple components. We needed to ensure configuration validity at startup and provide clear feedback for configuration errors. We considered simple validation, data annotations, or custom validation systems.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive configuration validation system with `IConfigurationValidator` that validates configuration models and provides detailed error reporting with warnings for suboptimal settings.

## Rationale
1. **Fail Fast**: Invalid configurations are caught at startup
2. **Clear Feedback**: Detailed error messages help with troubleshooting
3. **Flexible**: Support for both errors (blocking) and warnings (informational)
4. **Maintainable**: Centralized validation logic
5. **Development Friendly**: Clear guidance on configuration requirements

## Consequences
### Positive
- Configuration errors caught early in application lifecycle
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Support for both validation errors and warnings
- Centralized configuration validation logic
- Better development and deployment experience

### Negative
- Additional validation code to maintain
- Potential startup delay for complex validation
- Need to keep validation rules in sync with configuration changes
- Additional complexity in configuration system

## Implementation
- `AgentSystemConfiguration` models define configuration structure
- `ConfigurationValidator` implements validation rules
- `ValidationResult` provides structured error and warning reporting
- Integration with .NET configuration system
- Startup validation with clear error reporting
