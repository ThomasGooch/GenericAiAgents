## Context
We needed to design a generic AI agent system that could support multiple types of agents with different capabilities while maintaining consistency, extensibility, and maintainability. The system needed to support both simple agents and complex AI-powered agents.

## Decision
We will adopt a modular architecture based on core abstractions (`IAgent`) with a base implementation (`BaseAgent`) that provides common functionality. This approach separates concerns into distinct modules:

- **Agent.Core**: Core abstractions and base implementations
- **Agent.Tools**: Extensible tool system for agent capabilities  
- **Agent.AI**: AI integration layer (Semantic Kernel)
- **Agent.Registry**: Agent and tool discovery mechanisms
- **Agent.Orchestration**: Workflow and coordination engine

## Rationale
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
2. **Extensibility**: New agent types can be added without modifying core components
3. **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
4. **Reusability**: Components can be used independently or together
5. **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries reduce coupling and improve maintainability

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easy to extend with new agent types
- Individual components are testable and maintainable
- Supports both simple and AI-powered agents
- Framework can be used as individual libraries

### Negative
- Additional complexity compared to monolithic approach
- Inter-module dependencies need careful management
- Learning curve for understanding the full architecture

## Implementation
- Core `IAgent` interface defines agent contract
- `BaseAgent` provides common functionality (lifecycle, health checks)
- Dependency injection enables loose coupling between modules
- Each module is a separate NuGet package/assembly
