# ADR-008: Multi-Tier Secret Management

## Status
**Accepted** - September 23, 2025

## Context
Our agent system needs to handle secrets (API keys, connection strings, certificates) securely across different environments. We needed to support local development (environment variables), testing (in-memory), and production (Azure Key Vault) scenarios while maintaining security best practices.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-tier secret management system with `ISecretManager` abstraction supporting multiple backends: `EnvironmentSecretManager` for development, `AzureKeyVaultSecretManager` for production, and `CachedSecretManager` for performance optimization.

## Rationale
1. **Security**: Proper secret handling with no hardcoded values
2. **Environment Flexibility**: Different secret sources for different environments  
3. **Performance**: Caching layer to reduce external calls
4. **Enterprise Ready**: Azure Key Vault support for production scenarios
5. **Development Friendly**: Simple environment variable approach for development

## Consequences
### Positive
- No secrets stored in code or configuration files
- Environment-appropriate secret management
- Performance optimization through caching
- Enterprise-grade security for production
- Easy development setup

### Negative
- Multiple secret management implementations to maintain
- Configuration complexity across environments
- Potential secret caching security concerns
- Dependency on external services for production

## Implementation
- `ISecretManager` defines secret access contract
- `EnvironmentSecretManager` reads from environment variables
- `AzureKeyVaultSecretManager` integrates with Azure Key Vault
- `CachedSecretManager` wraps other implementations for performance
- `SecretConfigurationProvider` integrates with .NET configuration system
